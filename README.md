# ✂️ LangChain Text Splitters

Break Text → Into Chunks → For Smarter AI.

This repository explores LangChain Text Splitters, powerful utilities that divide long pieces of text into manageable chunks. Splitting is essential when working with LLMs, embeddings, and RAG pipelines, ensuring that models can process information efficiently and without exceeding context limits.

# 🌟 What Are Text Splitters?

Text Splitters are tools in LangChain that:

✨ Break large documents into smaller parts

📏 Respect token or character limits of LLMs

📚 Preserve context while splitting intelligently

⚡ Enable faster and more accurate retrieval for QA and summarization



# 🚀 Why Use Text Splitters?

🤖 Chat with Documents → Chunk text for embeddings & retrieval

📑 Summarization → Process long documents in parts

📊 RAG Pipelines → Split large datasets for efficient context injection

🎯 Optimized LLM Usage → Stay within token limits without losing meaning

# 🌍 Example Use Cases

Research papers split into sections for QA bots

Legal contracts chunked for clause-level analysis

CSV/Reports split for data-driven insights

Books/articles split for summarization
